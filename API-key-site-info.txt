It is completely normal to feel overwhelmed by that sidebar; it is designed to cover every possible use case from high-frequency trading to long-term academic research.

To stick to your current **"Insider Trading + Health Check"** strategy, you only need to care about **three specific sections**. Here is your "Cheat Sheet" for which options matter and which you can safely ignore:

### **1. The "Must-Haves" (Your Validation Layer)**

These are the endpoints that will tell you if the company insiders are buying is actually healthy or a "Value Trap".

* **Financial Ratios TTM:** This is your most important tool. It calculates everything for you so you don't have to do the math. Look here for:
* **Debt-to-Equity Ratio:** To see if they are drowning in debt.
* **Current Ratio:** To ensure they can pay their bills this year.


* **Key Metrics TTM:** Use this to see the "Quality" of the company.
* **ROIC (Return on Invested Capital):** To see if management is actually good at spending money.
* **Free Cash Flow Yield:** To see if the company is a "cash machine".


* **Financial Scores:** This provides "shortcuts" like the **Altman Z-Score** (bankruptcy risk) and the **Piotroski Score** (overall financial strength).

### **2. The "Context" Layer (The 2026 Strategy)**

According to the **2026 AI Valuation Reckoning** document, you need to distinguish between "transient beneficiaries" and "genuine enablers". These sidebar options help with that:

* **Company Profile:** Use this to quickly see the **Beta** (how much the stock swings compared to the market) and a description of what they actually do.
* **Enterprise Values:** This is better than "Market Cap" because it factors in debt. In a high-interest-rate environment like 2026, this is a more accurate "price tag" for a company.
* **Institutional Ownership (Form 13F):** Use this to see if "Whales" (like Michael Burry or Warren Buffett) are buying the same stocks as the insiders.

### **3. What you can IGNORE (for now)**

To keep your script simple and fast, don't worry about these yet:

* **Technical Indicators (RSI, Moving Averages):** These are for *timing* a trade, not for deciding *if* a company is healthy.
* **Economics (Treasury Rates, etc.):** While important for the big picture, they won't help you validate a specific stock ticker.
* **Intraday Charts (1 Min, 5 Min):** You aren't day-trading; you are looking for long-term conviction.

### **Your "Next Step" Implementation:**

When you update your script, focus your code on this specific URL format (using your new key):

**Would you like me to map out a "Health Check" scorecard for you?** I can tell you exactly which numbers (like a Debt-to-Equity under 1.5) you should look for in those "bigilion" options to confirm a "Buy" signal.
